Quantum Computing Tutorial
==========================

A set of simple programs for learning how to program a quantum computer.

## What is it?

Quantum computing is a fundamentally new form of computing technology based upon quantum physics and its inherent properties of superposition and entanglement. It brings a new paradigm to programming, where algorithms can be created that can process exponentially more data than classical computers that rely on transistor-based technology.

This project contains a set of basic example programs to learn about programming a quantum computer.

Several tutorial examples are included in this repository including the projects listed below.

```python
pip install qiskit
pip install ConfigParser
```

### Hello World

### Superposition

### Cloning a Qubit

### The Deutsch Jozsa Algorithm

### Fly Unicorn
